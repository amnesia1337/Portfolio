"Security, much like life itself, is not convenient." -Amnesia

Focused on creating secure systems that prioritize privacy, security, and usability, constantly pushing the envelope on encryption and privacy-preserving technologies, in order to protect the human right to privacy.

## Profile Summary üåü
Grayson Giles (Amnesia) is a freelance Information Security Researcher/Consultant and Linux Developer/Maintainer who serves as the Lead Maintainer of **LainOS**. With a strong focus on privacy and security, Grayson has a proven track record in Linux system development and communication frameworks. He has made notable contributions to the **QubesOS** and **Whonix** projects, and has developed his own security project, **VESME**. Their commitment to developing reliable tools, environments, and solutions has contributed to the growth of privacy and security technologies within the information security and open-source communities.

## Key Projects üõ†Ô∏è

### VESME (Virtualized Ephemeral Secure Messaging Environment) üí¨

* **Description**: A communication framework designed for secure messaging within the Linux Terminal Application of Android, which runs within the Android Virtualization Framework. VESME aims to provide a pioneering open-source **High Assurance Platform** for secure communications on mobile devices using virtualization, encryption, and ephemeral computing, designed for those facing heavy surveillance or censorship.
* **Key Features**:

  * Designed to look inconspicuous(like taking notes etc...) and 'hide' within the terminal application.
  * Multi-layered security architecture that aligns with the goals of ISO and NIST standards.
  * Utilizes PGP for XMPP account authentication and OMEMO encrypted XMPP over Tor for secure messaging.
  * Ensures no residual data remains after use through manual VM wipe. Toggle terminal off in developer options for instant data wipe(instant, destroys disk image), or reinstall terminal for thorough overwrite(10-15 mine).
  * Integrates traffic obfuscation techniques to enhance privacy.
  * A pioneering example of ephemeral computing utilizing virtualization in mobile security.
  * Future plans include a CLI fork of Ricochet Refresh for integration into VESME, to offer a serverless choice.
* **Repository**: [VESME on GitLab](https://gitlab.com/amnesia1337/vesme-avf)

### LainOS üñ•Ô∏è

As the lead developer of **LainOS**, a Linux distribution inspired by the anime "Serial Experiments Lain," Grayson has played a pivotal role in shaping a secure and privacy-focused operating system with cyberpunk and anime aesthetics aimed at developers, tinkeres, and hackers.

* **Secure Architecture**: Developed a system that prioritizes user privacy and integrates various security features such as MAC randomization by default, making it a reliable choice for users concerned about their digital footprint.
* **Community-Driven**: Collaborated with a global community of developers to emphasize user security and privacy, fostering an inclusive environment for innovation.
* **Technical Specifications**: Based on **Arch Linux**, featuring lightweight window managers like **Hyprland** and **Openbox**.
* **Tools and Utilities**: Includes essential tools for network analysis (Wireshark, Nmap), exploitation (Metasploit), and privacy (Tor, I2P, Keepass, Kleopatra, Kloak).
* **Website**: [LainOS Official Site](https://lainos.dev) | **Repository**: [LainOS on GitHub](https://github.com/The-LainOS-Project)

### Contributions to QubesOS and Whonix üîí

* **QubesOS**: Diagnosed, fixed, and enhanced the broken Snowflake Tor pluggable transport feature, while significantly improving its reliability, thus improving the anti-censorship and user anonymity capabilities of QubesOS.

  * **Guide**: [Quick Start Guide for Snowflake Proxy in Qubes/Whonix](https://forum.qubes-os.org/t/quick-start-guide-snowflake-proxy-in-qubes-whonix-tor-control-panel/28889)

* **Whonix**: Fixed and enhanced the broken Snowflake Tor pluggable transport feature in Whonix Tor control panel, thus improving the anti-censorship and user anonymity capabilities of Whonix, featured and credited on the Whonix Bridges Wiki page.
